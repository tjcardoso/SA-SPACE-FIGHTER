SA Space Fighter AD2981

Created May 27, 2016.

This is a vertically scrolling 2D space shooter built in Swift for iOS.

I used the Archetapp “Space Shooter” tutorial to help myself learn the basics and to get a starting point for the game. Link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeW6SCQv–o


It has not been pushed to the app store and is currently in development.
